<h3>Project Objectives</h3>

To increase the efficiency of Lebwhol Lasher model, coded in Python, by investigating and reducing code bottlenecks. A combination of techniques were used including OpenMP, MPI and C++, as well as Python modules numba and numpy.

<h3>Background</h3>
<h5>Lebwohl Lasher model:</h5>

<h5>Increasing the efficiency:</h5>


<h3>Results</h3>

Implemented combinations of accelleration methods to reduce bottlenecks in the computationally intensive Lebwohl Lasher method. Key results include:
