Biscuit dunking is an essential aspect of British culture, whether you're dunking chocolate coated biscuits, oat, or digestives, everyone is guilty of the occasional dunk. This can lead even to the point of rivalry, betweeen the one second dunkers and the die hard, wait as long as you can without the biscuit crumbling camp. An investigation into McVities biscuit dunking data has been conducted to clear the air on the difference between three types of biscuits: Digestives, Hobnobs, and Rich Tea. 

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>

This investigation aimed to explore the physical differences between biscuits through empirical data collected from dunking experiments. It analyzed the applicability of capillary flow action to biscuits, examining the relationship between the pore radius and capillary flow rate during dunking. This translated into insights on how tea travels up the different types of biscuit. Machine Learning methods were investigated for the classication of biscuit type, as well as for modelling the pore radius of the biscuits. 

<h3>Background</h3>

<h5>Biscuit dunking data:</h5> Three seperate databases were provided, the dunking data,

<h5>Washburn Equation:</h5>

The Washburn equation is a fundemental model of capillary flow action, its performance for the modelling of capillary flow action was analysed using the microscopy data, it was found to predict accurately for these data points, therefore was used as a starting point for predicting the pore radii of the remaining biscuit data.

<h5>Machine Learning approach:</h5> 

Biscuit classification attempted with and without the pore radius, finding greatly improved classification with the pore radius included.
