## Oxford

<img src="../images/oxford.jpg" alt="Oxford">

Growing up in Oxford, I adopted a strong academic foundation that shaped my intellectual development. At A-level, I took Chemistry, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Computer Science, and Russian, allowing me to focus on the sciences and analytical disciplines. I was captivated by Chemistry through its balance of theory and practical application, with seemingly endless new combinations of possible molecular structures. Similarly, Computing swept up my attention with Python, my first memories being with the turtle module, making little art peices using code. My high school coding development culminated in a simple poker agent that would use conterfactual regret minimization to decide moves on a given hand. Overall my A levels allowed me to develop an in depth understanding of statistics, computational logic, and chemical fundamentals. I decided to further pursue these interests in my University course: Chemistry with Scientific Computing

## Bristol

My interdisciplinary programme at the University of Bristol was the first to combine both Chemistry and Computing at the University, as a result I felt at the forefront of scientific advancement, learning about the countless applications of Computing in Chemistry. The course allowed us to explore chemical models and theories, subsequently applying these models in data-driven analysis. Moreover, it helped me develop best coding practices for both Software Engineering and Data Science projects. The program not only honed my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of collaboration and communication in scientiic research. Engaging in group projects, as well as my independent Masters project in the final year, enriched my understanding of how diverse perspectives can drive innovation. This unique experiene gained through laboratory work, in combination with computational simulations, reinforced my ability to tackle complex problems and to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

## I got inspired by...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2]. Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002. [GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide. [Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress. And many, many more...

Please make *Feeling Responsive* yours and if you like it, please link back to my homebase <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. That would be awesome.

#### Since then, fork it!

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][7]
